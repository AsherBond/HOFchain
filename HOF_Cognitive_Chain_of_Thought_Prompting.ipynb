# HOF Cognitive Chain-of-Thought Prompting
This notebook demonstrates HOF Cognitive Chain-of-Thought Prompting using TensorFlow, focusing on software planning and code generation as a cohesive process for software development.

## Import Required Libraries
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
```

## Define Higher-Order Cognitive Functions
```python
def apply_operation(input_data, operation):
    """Applies a given operation to the input data."""
    return operation(input_data)

def chain_of_thought(input_data, operations):
    """Applies a chain of operations to the input data."""
    for operation in operations:
        input_data = apply_operation(input_data, operation)
    return input_data
```

## Define Atomic Cognitive Operations for Software Planning
```python
def gather_requirements(project):
    project["requirements"] = ["Feature A", "Feature B", "Feature C"]
    return project

def define_tasks(project):
    project["tasks"] = {
        "Feature A": ["Task A1", "Task A2"],
        "Feature B": ["Task B1", "Task B2"],
        "Feature C": ["Task C1", "Task C2"]
    }
    return project

def estimate_time(project):
    project["time_estimates"] = {
        "Task A1": 5,
        "Task A2": 3,
        "Task B1": 8,
        "Task B2": 6,
        "Task C1": 4,
        "Task C2": 7
    }
    return project

def assign_resources(project):
    project["resources"] = {
        "Task A1": "Developer 1",
        "Task A2": "Developer 2",
        "Task B1": "Developer 3",
        "Task B2": "Developer 1",
        "Task C1": "Developer 2",
        "Task C2": "Developer 3"
    }
    return project

def set_milestones(project):
    project["milestones"] = ["Milestone 1", "Milestone 2", "Milestone 3"]
    return project
```

## Define Atomic Cognitive Operations for Code Generation
```python
def generate_code(project):
    project["code"] = {
        "Task A1": "def feature_a1(): pass",
        "Task A2": "def feature_a2(): pass",
        "Task B1": "def feature_b1(): pass",
        "Task B2": "def feature_b2(): pass",
        "Task C1": "def feature_c1(): pass",
        "Task C2": "def feature_c2(): pass"
    }
    return project

def integrate_code(project):
    integrated_code = "\n".join([code for task in project["code"].values() for code in task])
    project["integrated_code"] = integrated_code
    return project

def deploy_code(project):
    project["deployment"] = "Code deployed to production environment."
    return project
```

## Example Project (Cognitive Input)
```python
project_plan = {"name": "Project X"}
```

## Chain of Operations for Software Planning and Code Generation
```python
operations = [
    gather_requirements, 
    define_tasks, 
    estimate_time, 
    assign_resources, 
    set_milestones,
    generate_code,
    integrate_code,
    deploy_code
]
```

## Applying the HOF Cognitive Chain-of-Thought
```python
final_project_plan = chain_of_thought(project_plan, operations)
```

## Display the Result
```python
for key, value in final_project_plan.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

## Conclusion
In this notebook, we demonstrated the concept of HOF Cognitive Chain-of-Thought Prompting by applying a series of cognitive operations to develop a software project plan and generate code. This cohesive process showcases the flexibility and composability of higher-order cognitive functions in practical software development.
